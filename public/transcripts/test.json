There is no reason given for the adjournment request.  I've been meaning unavailability reference, and that simply means that this district has other hearings and decided a more important meeting that they would rather do instead of today's hearing.  The hearing was scheduled over two months ago and it was scheduled as a one and a half hour for witness testimony.  So we are going to be proceeding today.

But she, we've found that she does responds to technology and in combination with her speech and language pathologist and the teacher, we've really worked to figure out you know, how to best tap into what she knows.  And that seems to be through devices.  But the, the small, like we have an iPad that we can use at school with her, but it's it has some communication apps on it.  The, the device is an iPad size, so it's hard again for her most quickly to make those finer discriminations.  We've found and the evaluation found that she needs a larger screen.  She also needs something to mount it on because she tends to touch things.  She doesn't have that great motor control.

        "Text": "Okay.  In New York State, the deal carries the burden of proving it offered an education that comports with the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.  Here, the district fell far short of meeting its burden because the DMV failed to appear failed, failed to defend the IEP or the placement.  The Higgins are not required to show that the IEP is inappropriate or that the program is that appropriate.  But evidence on the record shows their attempts to improve the IEP and assess the placement through correspondence with the deal.  The SECONDS described participation in the IEP meeting and her efforts to locate and assess a program appropriate for her daughter was significant mobility limitations and depends upon equipment and nurse throughout the day.  She testified that her efforts were ignored and as a result she enrolled her daughter at the Mother Francisca Elementary School in time for her to begin school in July.  The parent carried her burden of demonstrating the appropriateness of the placement under the controlling cases of Frenchie and Guiliano to qualify for reimbursement under the FDA.  Parents did not show that a private placement furnishes every special service necessary to maximize her child's potential.  She need only demonstrate that the placement provides educational instruction specially designed to meet the unique needs of a child with a disability supported by such services as are necessary to permit the child to benefit from instruction.  Dr. Taranto, the mother Francisca, school director, described a small, structured program in which Addison and the other students are functionally grouped in classrooms that use a variety of curricula and techniques.  The overarching curriculum is faces an academic curriculum that integrates functional skills into instruction in all the academic areas.  Addison works on independent goals one on one and then practices in very small groups.  The school places an emphasis on activities of daily living and social skills development, and its program is monitored regularly through review of data and classroom observations, both formal and informal.  Addison receives related services at the school through RCA, as issued by the deal.  The therapists are provided by an agency contracted through the DOJ and reintegrated into the school environment.  They're offered training and professional development with the rest of the staff and participate in school activities.  They're in constant communication with the teachers.  School integrates the therapies into the program and provides well appointed private therapy space and equipment to ensure that Addison can benefit from the therapy during the school day without impacting her academic program.  Dr. Taranto described that although the school integrates therapies into the school program for all of the students, parents may use therapists at their discretion at the school or through an outside agency.  This kind of arrangement has been sanctioned by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in 2012.  MH affirmed the district court's holding that a school is appropriate, even though it does not provide related services on site.  the Court cited the lower court's reasoning that parents are entitled to more flexibility in their choice of placement than than the date.  The district has an obligation to provide services at no charge to parents as well-settled.  The use of RSA as contract and contract providers in New York City, even in public schools, has been acknowledged by the Court of Appeals in that bill, which stated that even public schools in New York have been known to provide related services by contracting with outside providers or issuing or essays.  Parents or schools.  Use of viruses to fulfill related service mandates does not compel a finding that any school, public or private is in an inappropriate because it does not have in-house clinicians.  The school chosen by the Higgins provides specialized instruction by specially trained and licensed special educators using the recommended methodologies all day long.  According to longstanding Supreme Court and circuit precedent.  An appropriate private placement did not meet state education standards or requirements or provide certified special education teachers or an IEP for the disabled student when a parent is required to provide an appropriate education because the district failed to do so.  It's permissible for her to deviate from The State education standards or requirements to develop an educational placement that suits the individual needs of her child.  A parent's unilateral placement turns on whether a placement, private or public, is reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefit.  Dr. Taranto discussed that Addison has made good progress during the year.  Her parents acted in good faith and an appropriate private placement after the jury failed to provide a fee and some.  An appropriate relief at all times.  They were fully engaged and cooperative in the process.  Notwithstanding the deal's failure to address their concerns about the IP and the placement, the family persisted in attempting to find that for appropriate public education, their contact with the deal was regular and notice was timely.  In compliance with the statute and weighing the equities courts.  Consider whether the parent has cooperated throughout the process to ensure our child receives a fake with time to plan.  Higgins has expressed their concerns with the IEP, especially the recommendation for the highly restrictive 12 to 1 to 4 setting and their problem with not being able to access the offer placement equities.  We decided we are against the deal.  We who did not directly respond to parents concerns, telling them they would need to go back to the team if they disagree.  The idea provides that apparently a ten day notice prior to a unilateral placement to give the district a meaningful opportunity to maximize its expenses by developing a program on placement that would provide the child's and appropriate education within the school district.  By ignoring the Higgins the deal, we squandered their opportunity.  The seconds demonstrated that she was under a contractual obligation to pay the tuition at the school.  She offered the family tax return and testified that the income support family and that it would be a hardship to pay the annual tuition and wait for reimbursement.  She testified that the DOE is responsible for tuition payment and dependency and in fact testified that they have already paid the Department of Education.  In conclusion, we ask Your Honor to find that the D.O.T. failed to provide the Higgins of State for the 2122 school year that the mother Francisca Elementary School is an appropriate unilateral placement and that equity support a finding fully favorable to the Higgins.  At this point, acknowledging that tuition together with the related services issued through our associates are an appropriate placement for Addison.  We also ask for an immediate order for the duty to provide the equipment that is required for Addison to to make appropriate progress and has been recommended on the IEP, which specifically is the assistive technology device, the stand for the activity chair, and are assays that permit the visual education therapy to be delivered either remote or in-person according to the therapists requirements.
